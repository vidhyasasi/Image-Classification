# Image-Classification

## Business Problem:

BrandMind a clothing brand, contains multiple clothing categories including so this project aims to classify the clothing categories.
## Overview
The goal of this project is to create TensorFlow models to perform the classification of different clothing items.
The Main Parts of this project is as follows:
+ Data Preparation:
Downloads, understands, and prepares the image data for modeling.
+ Model Creation:
Constructs Tensorflow models for classifications and trained with a pre trained model using transfer flow.
+ Model Evaluation:
Evaluating the model performances based on Classification accuracy.
